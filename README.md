This is a simple presentation I made with [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/) documenting my Land Stewardship project.

It has css to make the font bigger, an include to get rid of the menu bar when fullscreen, some videos in a gallery that autoplay, photos standalone and in galleries.

It can be viewed online at [https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montyz/landstewards/main/slides.md#1](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montyz/landstewards/main/slides.md#1)
