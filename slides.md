## Stewardship plan
In 2005 we got an ODF grant to write a Stewardship Plan. My wife Jane Anderson co-authored it. So lucky me, I already had that homework done!

One of our primary goals moving here is to preserve and enhance wildlife habitat. Part of my learnings here is to remove fences and to sow pollinator plants. We have black bear, bobcat, deer, great gray owls, rough skinned newts and much more. 

## Solar house

Our house is earth bermed and heated with wood and sunshine. We have a rain catchment system that gravity feeds our plumbing. We pump water up to it with our well.

## Goal
To live sustainably in a healthy forest that supports a diverse web of life and works with fire.
