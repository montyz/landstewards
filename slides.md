One of our primary goals moving here is to preserve and enhance wildlife habitat. Part of my learnings here is to remove fences and to sow pollinator plants. We have black bear, bobcat, deer, great gray owls, rough skinned newts and much more.

Our house is earth bermed and heated with wood and sunshine. We have a rain catchment system that gravity feeds our plumbing. We pump water up to it with our well.
